# PCA (Principal Component Analysis)



## Questions

Q 1. [Why do we maximize variance during PCA?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12395542/why-do-we-maximize-variance-during-principal-component-analysis)

- Variance is a measure of the **variability** of the data you have. We want to squeeze the most imformation in each component of the finite set you build
- It rotates the data set in such a way as to align the directions in which it is spread out the most with the principal axes. This enables to remove those dimensions along which the data is almost flat.
- Maximizing variance minimizes squared error.



Q 2. [Why is the eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue of a covariance matrix equal to a principal component?](https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/23596/why-is-the-eigenvector-of-a-covariance-matrix-equal-to-a-principal-component)



Q 3. PC, eigenvector with the largest eigenvalue, maximize variance, entropyâ€¦ tell the relations.
